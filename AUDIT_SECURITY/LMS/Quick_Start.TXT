Oracle License Management Services Collection Tool - Quick Start Guide
*****************************************************************************

The LMS Collection Tool will search a machine for files and information relevant to an Oracle Software installation.
This information will be gathered together and placed into files in a given output directory.
The output files should be returned to your license review contact.

Requirements Summary and Documentation: Please see included LMS_Collection_Tool_User's_Instructions_(version).pdf for full requirements.


*****************************************
UNIX/Linux
*****************************************

    a. Starting the program on a UNIX or Linux system

        1.  Copy the Oracle_LMS_Collection_Tool.zip file to the target system, in the selected location.

        2.  Open a Terminal window.

        3.  Log into the target system as root.  ***If you log on as another user the search may not pick up all of the necessary Oracle Software Files.***

        4.  Go to the directory where you placed the Oracle_LMS_Collection_Tool.zip file and extract the files.
            $unzip Oracle_LMS_Collection_Tool.zip.

        5.  Go to the Oracle_LMS_Collection_Tool directory.
            $ cd Oracle_LMS_Collection_Tool/LMSCollection

        6.  It is mandatory to add read, write, and execute permission to for all the files and folders
            $ chmod -R 777 *

        7.  Go to the bin directory and type 'LMSCollection.sh' with the proper options to run.  If no options are specified, the script will prompt the user for product(s) to search for.  Default values are used for all other options.
            $ cd bin
            $ ./LMSCollection.sh <OPTIONS>  ***See below for common examples***

                Product(s) to be searched       Command(s) and Option(s) to use
                All products                    $ ./LMSCollection.sh -d / -p all
                DB                              $ ./LMSCollection.sh -d / -p DB
                EBS                             $ ./LMSCollection.sh -d / -p EBS
                OAS                             $ ./LMSCollection.sh -d / -p OAS
                WLS                             $ ./LMSCollection.sh -d / -p WLS
                SOA                             $ ./LMSCollection.sh -d / -p SOA
                OBI                             $ ./LMSCollection.sh -d / -p OBI
                Webcenter                       $ ./LMSCollection.sh -d / -p Webcenter
                Multiple Products               $ ./LMSCollection.sh -d "/opt/software, /home/software" -p WLS,SOA,OAS
                FMW                             $ ./LMSCollection.sh -d / -p FMW

                Note: the syntax of all available command line options is as follows
                    [-d search_dir] [-fsall true | false] [-o full_path_dir_name] [-follow true|false] [-debug true|false] [-m all|ip|user] [-L Y|y] [-p product] [-fastsearch] [-r remote_user@remote_machine|remoteLMS.txt] [-tns]

                Refer to Table 9 in the LMS_Collection_Tool_User's_Instructions_(version).pdf documentation for instructions on the options available for you to use. Refer to Table 10 in the same document for specific examples.

        8.  Determining if the script is still running.
            The Oracle LMS Collection Tool searches for several possible configuration, registry, and log files on the target machine. To verify that the Oracle LMS Collection Tool is running, you will see a spinning “\” .  In addition you can use the following UNIX commands:

            $ ps -ef | grep find
            $ tail -f /<output_dir>/FMWfiles.*
                While the script is running you will see active updating of the FMWfiles.* file

        9.  After the tool has finished running, an output directory and a .tar (.tar.bz2 or .tar.Z) file that contains Oracle Software related files will be created.  This output directory can be found in the directory where the main LMSCollection.sh script is run.  For example, /tmp/LMSCT/LMSCollection/bin/output

        10. Return the output file 'LMSCollection-<MACHINE_NAME>.tar' (.tar.bz2 or .tar.Z), to your LMS representative per the instructions that were provided to you.

        11. Partitioned Servers - Processor Queries Scripts
            If server partitioning is in use, in addition to running the Oracle LMS Collection Tool from within the partition on which the Oracle software is deployed, the Oracle LMS Collection Tool needs to be run on the operating system of the underlying server hardware to collect the relevant CPU information. If using an embedded hypervisor, such as VMware, please consult with your LMS representative for instructions.

            example of running the Processor Queries only.
            $ ./LMSCollection.sh -p LMSCPU


*****************************************
Windows
*****************************************

        1.  Copy the Oracle_LMS_Collection_Tool.zip file to the target system.

        2.  Log into the target Windows system as Administrator.  ***If you log on as another user the search may not pick up all of the necessary Oracle Software Files.***

        3.  Unzip the Oracle_LMS_Collection_Tool.zip file to the same directory that the file is located.

        4.  Open a command prompt window.
            Go to Windows 'Start' > 'Run' menu and type 'cmd'

        5.  Go to the Oracle_LMS_Collection_Tool bin folder.
            c:\> cd Oracle_LMS_Collection_Tool\LMSCollection\bin

        6.  Type 'LMSCollection.cmd' with the proper options to run.  If no options are specified, the script will prompt the user for product(s) to search for.  Default values are used for all other options.
            c:\>LMSCollection.cmd <OPTIONS>  ***See below for common examples***

                Product(s) to be searched       Command(s) and Option(s) to use
                All Products                    c:\> LMSCollection.cmd -p all -d c:\,d:\
                DB                              c:\> LMSCollection.cmd -p DB -d c:\,d:\
                EBS                             c:\> LMSCollection.cmd -p EBS -d c:\,d:\
                OAS                             c:\> LMSCollection.cmd -p OAS -d c:\,d:\
                WLS                             c:\> LMSCollection.cmd -p WLS -d c:\,d:\
                SOA                             c:\> LMSCollection.cmd -p SOA -d c:\,d:\
                OBI                             c:\> LMSCollection.cmd -p OBI -d c:\,d:\
                Webcenter                       c:\> LMSCollection.cmd -p Webcenter -d c:\,d:\
                Multiple Products               c:\> LMSCollection.cmd -p WLS,SOA,OAS -d c:\,d:\
                FMW                             c:\> LMSCollection.cmd -p FMW -d c:\,d:\

                Note: the syntax of all available command line options is as follows.
                    [-d search_dir] [-p product] [-o full_path_dir_name] [-debug true|false] [-m all|ip|user] [-L Y|y][-fastsearch] [-tns]

                Refer to Table 11 in the LMS_Collection_Tool_User's_Instructions_(version).pdf documentation for instructions on the options available for you to use. Refer to Table 12 in the same document for specific examples.

        7.  Determining if the script is still running.
            The Oracle LMS Collection Tool searches for several possible configuration, registry and log files on the target machine. To verify that Oracle LMS Collection Tool is running, you can use the Windows Task Manager and look in the Applications tab for the cmd window with LMS Collection Tool.

        8.  After the tool has finished running the data collection, an output folder and a .zip file that contains Oracle Software related files will be created.  This output directory can be found in the directory where the main LMSCollection.sh script is run.  For example, c:\LMSCT\LMSCollection\bin\output

        9.  Return the output file 'LMSCollection-<MACHINE_NAME>.zip', to your LMS representative per the instructions that were provided to you.

        10. Partitioned Servers - Processor Queries Scripts
            If server partitioning is in use, in addition to running the Oracle LMS Collection Tool from within the partition on which the Oracle software is deployed, the Oracle LMS Collection Tool needs to be run on the operating system of the underlying server hardware to collect the relevant CPU information. If using an embedded hypervisor, such as VMware, please consult with your LMS representative for instructions.

            example of running the Processor Queries only.
            c:\> LMSCollection.cmd -p LMSCPU
