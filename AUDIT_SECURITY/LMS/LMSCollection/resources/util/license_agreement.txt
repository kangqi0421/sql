Terms for Oracle License Management Services ("LMS") Software

If you have an Oracle license agreement for your use of the Oracle software programs that are under review or audit by Oracle and/or that you wish to measure, monitor, or manage (collectively, "Programs") - such as an Oracle Master Agreement, Oracle License and Services Agreement, Oracle PartnerNetwork Agreement, Oracle distribution agreement, or other Oracle license agreement for the Programs (each a "Master Agreement") - then the Master Agreement applies to your use of the Oracle software provided with these terms ("Software") and the License Agreement displayed below does not apply to you.  When a Master Agreement applies, (a) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Master Agreement, your use of the Software shall be limited to measuring, monitoring and/or managing your usage of the Programs and Oracle's liability for the Software shall be no more than the amount that applies under the Master Agreement for the Programs; and (b) you acknowledge that using the Software, in and of itself, does not constitute an audit under the terms of your Master Agreement.

If a Master Agreement does not apply then the License Agreement displayed below applies to your use of the Software.

By selecting "Accept License Agreement" (or the equivalent) or by typing the required acceptance text you indicate your acceptance of these terms and your agreement, as an authorized representative of your company or organization (if being acquired for use by an entity) or as an individual, to comply with the license terms that apply to the Software.  If you are not willing to be bound by these terms, do not indicate your acceptance and do not download, install, or use the Software.
